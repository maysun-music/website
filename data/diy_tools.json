    "short_description": "This performance instrument uses surrounding space as source material, capturing sound through an embedded microphone and shaping it in real time. Each momentary switch triggers deeply curated processing, using looping, repeats, and granular synthesis to create full soundscapes. It sculpts the room into evolving patterns and tones that cycle back for further transformation. The instrument also features a polyphonic synth voice to add harmonic layers into the processing. Everything is aimed at shaping space.",
    "back_story": "I designed this synth after years of trying out different setups. I moved from hardware synths to modular, to samplers, to working entirely in a DAW and many other combinations. My album work has always been shaped by reamping sounds into a space, and I’ve been trying to link that process to live performances for a while. Wanting something more intentional, portable, and easy to improvise with led me to create this device.",
    "future": "Planned improvements include designing a custom PCB for a slimmer profile, adding more input and output options, expanding the LED design, creating new soundscape states, optimizing CPU usage, and delegating some processing to analog circuitry.",

    "short_description": "Node-1 is a wall-mounted listening device. It captures ambient room sound such as voices, footsteps, and movement, and transforms it using granular textures and layered delays. It shifts through different internal states over a 30-minute cycle. A stabilizing synth voice plays slow chords that change qualities every few minutes, helping anchor the space when feedback becomes intense.",
    "back_story": "Node-1 is the foundation for CYCL. I was looking for a way to shape room sound into soundscapes. Reactive, but also generative. With multiple nodes, any space becomes a spatial listening system.",

    "short_description": "This device uses a Teensy 4.1 and MPU9250 to turn cymbal motion into 4 continuous MIDI CC signals (Y+, Y–, X+, X–), allowing real-time control of spatialization, textures, and other effects. The unit recalibrates its center when still, includes switches to mute CC channels for easier mapping in Ableton, and features a sensitivity knob for scaling data. It appears as USB-Device to any DAW. Paired with a hand-hammered steel cymbal from a previous DIY project, the system enables tactile, gesture-based modulation while performing.",
    "back_story": "I wanted a more tactile way to control sound. Something portable, expressive, and performable. Using only a cymbal and a laptop, I could shape spatial textures and effects from an acoustic source in real time. This paired naturally with a steel cymbal I shaped and hand-hammered in 2021, turning it into both an acoustic and electronic instrument.",
    "future": "Future versions will focus on improved stability, including more consistent calibration behavior and refined motion filtering for smoother control.",
