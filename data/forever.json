      "text": "There are videos of me banging on pots and pans at age 2, but it is around age 8 that I started asking for a drum set. I felt a special connection to the instrument after a college jazz band performed at my school, and I could feel the bass drum in my chest. I thought this was a calling from the instrument itself that only I could hear. Two years later, my parents gifted me a snare, a hi-hat, and a cardboard box, which my father rigged with a bass drum pedal. \nWe had a family computer in the room next to the play area, and when I was 12, my parents let me run an audio extension cable so the cheap Logitech computer mic could reach the ceiling above the drums. This became my first recording setup, where I would layer drums over electric piano using Audacity. \nI wasn't drawn to any specific style of music, but I knew I loved the feeling of sound. The music that filled my household was mostly '70s funk and the soundtracks from our weekly movie rentals. I was especially drawn to cinematic scores and later realized that many of them were composed by Philip Glass.",

I also became active on Cymbalholics and Ghostnote, which focused on cymbal making and drum building. \nIn 2005, YouTube came along, and I started searching for live performances, jumping from video to video. A turning point was discovering The Bad Plus. I had never seen a drummer like Dave King who placed small cymbals and objects on drums, and used kids' toys as part of his setup. On top of that, their music felt free, with constantly shifting beats, everything seeming to fall apart yet staying strongly connected. It was chaotic and structured at the same time. It felt like the music was about the bigger picture, not just the individual parts. \nThat YouTube recommendation led me into jazz, where I found my most influential drummers like Brian Blade and Dan Weiss. I also became obsessed with piano trios like Tigran Hamasyan, Shai Maestro, and Brad Mehldau. I would go deep into entire discographies, listening to them on repeat for months, trying to absorb the vocabulary. The Smalls Live audio archive became an important tool for hearing raw sessions from these musicians."

By 2007, I was writing and recording full compositions, layering drums, piano, and bass. \nLater, I found Jack Conte's VideoSongs on YouTube. He was one of the first people creating music sessions from his home studio, performing every instrument with no lip-syncing or hidden sounds. His high output and creative video approach stood out to me. His music leaned more pop than what I typically allowed myself to listen to, but I loved the intricate harmonies, raw sound, and how the production process was fully visible.",

This trained musicians to learn quickly, sight-read with confidence, and write efficient lead sheets. Most graduates aimed to become TV set musicians, play in top 40 bands, or work cruise ship gigs. \nMy playing was soft and textural, and I was obsessed with odd meters, odd groupings, and quintuplets. None of which were popular with people in that program. Since I had already covered most of the drum curriculum in private lessons between ages 16 and 17, my drum teachers let me guide my own studies, giving me opportunities outside the standard curriculum. \nThey placed me in the Big Band and the Musical Theatre pit orchestra, making my degree more intensive. While the program was designed to prepare students for the industry, I planned to continue my studies at a university."

I decided to take a sabbatical year to save money and re-audition. \nI returned to the patio door factory where I had worked summers, now as a full-time employee. I took every overtime shift I could. Two extra hours in the morning, two at night, and some weekends. I treated the job like an learning an instrument, trying to optimize every motion. I became very fast. Eventually, overtime turned from optional to expected. \nThe work damaged my hands. I started getting electric shocks from hammering cheap plastic parts around glass. Turning round doorknobs or tying my shoes made my hands spasm. I was also gigging at night, and gripping sticks became increasingly difficult. \nThe factory usually laid off workers for the winter, starting with those who asked. I asked. But every week, they said “just a few more days,” again and again. My hands were getting worse, and I started to fear that the job I took to support my music would end up costing me exactly that. One night, ready to quit, I asked again to be cut. They said, “We’re keeping you all winter.” I felt the anger rise in my body, until they added, “Just kidding. You can go.” \nI got really sick right after, having pushed my body too far. My hands needed time to heal. I couldn’t properly prepare for the audition, but my attitude certainly changed. \nThe year before, I had played like what I thought the jury wanted to hear. This time, I played like my full self and was accepted. I think that assertive energy came from not wanting to ever go back to that patio door place.",

For the first time, I had no space to practice drums and had to rely on the school's rarely available practice rooms. The academic environment pressured me to write complex music, which led to a creative blockage. This drained the fun out of music, and I dropped out after a year. \nI then rented a tiny rehearsal space just big enough for a drum kit and a few mics. The walls were thin, and loud bands rehearsed around me, making it difficult to practice or record. To work around this, I started going in early mornings or late at night. \nThis is where I first experimented with electronics and drums, running an SM57 on the floor tom through an EHX Memory Man delay pedal, with a Microkorg for extra sounds. This is one of my earliest videos combining drums and electronics.",

His mathematical and visual approach to rhythm fascinated me. \nI applied for a Canadian grant to study in New York City with Dan Weiss, a longtime collaborator of Okazaki. The grant was denied. That rejection forced me to reassess my career path and rather than focusing on jazz, I decided to aim to make my name locally as a creative, textural drummer in the indie scene. \nOne of the drummers who stood out in this style was Robbie Kuster, Patrick Watson's drummer. I liked that he rarely played a traditional backbeat on the snare, instead using crashes, floor toms, and unconventional objects to mark time. Without realizing it, I was becoming more interested in sound design. \nI was already playing in a few indie/rock bands, and before long, I started accompanying the bands we opened for and the bands that opened for us. I'd offer to play with as many people as I could, running between venues to play multiple shows in a night. It felt like the right direction. \nI was playing so much that it soon made sense to move into a better shared rehearsal space with some of my bandmates. I spent nearly all my time there, rotating between different projects. I would record synth tracks at home in Logic and add drums to them between rehearsals. Over time, I set up my Microkorg, Boss RC-3, and a small mixer, which gave me more routing options for looping. This brought me back into experimenting with electronics and drums together.",

I created a set of strict rules to break my habits, like limiting myself to eight notes, no fills allowed, and never playing more than two consecutive notes with the same hand. I detuned my snare to finger-tight, eliminating rebound for ghost notes and removed the rack tom to block muscle-memory fills. I wanted my playing to be raw and minimalist, moving away from my more technical and intricate playing. I fell in love with flams and slow tempos. \nI believed that if I played with everyone, something would eventually work out. At one point, I was in about 25 different projects. Some bands started signing with labels, but every time that happened, I would lose the gig. Labels pushed them into duos or trios to open for their main acts, and drums were cut. This pattern kept repeating. To adapt, I started playing bass synth while drumming, hoping to make myself more indispensable. I swapped my Microkorg for a DSI Mopho X4. \nA sound engineer friend reached out, offering a free studio session to practice mic'ing drums. Without much planning, I asked two friends with cameras to capture the session. That day made me realize how important it was to understand every aspect of production. I wanted full control over my output, so I could work faster and maintain visibility. \nI continued experimenting with running my floor tom mic through effects, using an A/B pedal to switch the input on and off through a Dr. Scientist Reverberator and an EHX Memory Man Deluxe. On the Mopho X4, I maxed out the envelope's sustain, making notes last until I played four new ones. This meant I had to repeat triads to ensure no unwanted notes carried over. It also freed up my left hand to play drums. I could add weight to the sound by slowly opening the filter. \nI began focusing on building independence between my left hand on synths and my drumming, recording those practice sessions with my iPod Touch. I was also searching for ways to make the sound evolve within the one-hand limitation I was facing. \nThe EHX Pog2 became a key solution, allowing me to layer sounds by doubling them up to two octaves higher and lower. It also introduced a warbly, organ-like tone. I placed pedals on my snare for easy access while playing, which also dampened the snare sound.",

The local scene was small, and it felt like access to “the industry” was controlled by an exclusive group of people. The internet seemed like a way to bypass all of that and connect directly with fans. \nI wasn't supported in this idea, and it was pushed aside. This was when I started feeling artistically stuck, and realized I couldn't put more effort into a project than the bandleader. After all, these projects weren't actually mine. I existed in a gray area between an unpaid session musician and a core band member. That, combined with burnout, made me step away."

For this EP, I experimented with cassette tapes, scratching them with a utility knife and recording over the damaged tape. This introduced degraded sounds, artifacts from previous recordings, shifting stereo fields, and saturation. It also broke my tape machine. \nTo record drums, I went to an audio engineer friend's studio and brought back the tracks into logic.

The metallic light fixture in my apartment became the intro for \"Phases\". \"Tall Woman\" featured water from the drain outside my parents' house and streetcars from my apartment window. I saw this as a way for me to remember where I was during all of this. A kind of proof of existence by injecting space and time details into the recording. \nI also started experimenting with re-amping. Not being into plugins at the time, I looked for ways to physically alter sounds. Playing audio through my phone inside a box and mic'ing it from the outside for a muffled effect, or to create multiple versions of the same sound and layering them in the mix. Around this time, I bought external preamps, though they made little sense with my Zoom H6 as an interface. Since the Zoom was still the weak link, I ended up cranking the preamps for distortion rather than fidelity. The drums were once again recorded at my friend's studio. \nThis is also the birth of MAY SUN, as announced in the fifth track. Although not my project name yet.",

Mixing became an extension of composition, shaping the narrative just as much as the melodies and textures. \nWhile creating the music, I pictured walking across a frozen lake being blinded by the sun, yet still trusting the forward direction. I took this literally in Black Silver, where I recorded myself walking on ice for the full duration of the track. \nThis was the first project where I recorded everything myself, including drums. I borrowed mics from friends and recorded drums in my parents' basement. With more time to experiment, I used objects to prepare the drums. On White Peafowl, I slowly dropped a steel chain onto the snare before striking it.

To make things more difficult, I wasn't allowed to use my own cymbals, which threw me off. \nI didn't feel like I belonged there, but I got on stage and improvised. Playing in a huge, empty room without close mics made me realize how much I relied on mic'ing techniques to bring out the body of my playing. In my videos, I had full control over the audio, but here, my sound didn't project at all.

I knew I could improve much faster if I had a dedicated space to practice and record. But having an independent rehearsal space, without sharing gear, was really expensive and hard to come by.

I negotiated my way into a space with overnight slot, 1 a.m. to 9 a.m. The space was small and already shared by multiple projects which meant I couldn't keep my own drums there or leave anything set up. \nMy initial plan was to record a month's worth of videos before posting.

One hour and forty-five minutes is how long it took me that first day. \nI hit record, improvised some music, packed everything up, and left.

The idea was to like and comment on each other's videos to boost engagement. In practice, most were only there to receive likes, not to support others. The group quickly shrank to about five people but was still helpful. \nBack then, Instagram repost accounts were a major factor in growth. These curated pages had 50K–100K followers, and getting reposted by the right one could bring in 200–300 new followers overnight. This happened to me a few times. (This also no longer works with the shift to duets and the FYP.) \nHaving a permanent space allowed to refine my drum, synth, and recording setup. I added a second Sony a6000 camera for multiple angles, built DIY acoustic panels, and set up lighting so the back wall was dark enough for projections while keeping the drums visible. I moved on from the Zoom H6, and bought a Midas XL48 for eight additional channels to use with my RME Babyface. With 10 inputs, I could now fully mic my drum set and run DIs for synths. \nMy approach remained the same: complete everything. From the very first note or hit, I had to finish, produce, and post. Whether or not I liked the result could not matter. Skipping or deleting a session was not permitted. \nA rumor spread online that the Roland JU-06 was being discontinued, causing prices to triple on Reverb. I took the opportunity to sell mine and picked up a Moog Mother 32. My first semi-modular synth. It had a built-in sequencer and introduced me to modular synthesis.",

      "text": "Releasing a video per day while gigging required extreme organization. I structured everything in a calendar, keeping track of which videos were completed, in progress, or scheduled for release. I mapped out how many I needed in bank before shows or tours, so I wouldn't fall behind. Each video was cut down to 60 seconds for Instagram, with captions and hashtags pre-written in my notes for quick posting. \nMy computer struggled with video editing. I couldn't even preview edits. I blindly cut between two camera angles, added my intro logo with the video number, and placed a small watermark at the bottom which was important for repost accounts that didn't always include credits. \nI aimed to record three to four videos per day as a buffer, but sometimes had to rush through ten just to catch up. There was no time for second-guessing. After completing one, I switched camera angles quickly, threw random percussions on the drums to change the sound, and moved forward without hesitation. \nThrough constant trial and error, I found workarounds for many problems. Forgetting to open a mic channels, botching gain staging, cameras running out of battery and my computer crashing forced me to adapt. For example, I once forgot to arm the bass drum track, so I EQed a room mic, gated it, manually removed non-kick hits, and shaped it into a makeshift kick drum sound. For each session, I was experimenting with both conventional and unconventional techniques, often inspired by Ryan Earnhardt's YouTube channel, Creative Sound Lab. Unintentionally, I was moving deeper into sound design. \nAfter over 100 videos, I realized I was relying on cymbals too much to fill in space. It became a crutch. As a new creative constraint, I banned cymbals entirely from my setup for a few months. \nI also noticed the pull of social media engagement influencing my choices. Fast drumming, distorted beats, and arpeggiated synths consistently got more likes, but I didn't want to create for algorithms. I made a conscious effort to ignore those pressures and stay open to whatever direction my creativity wanted to take.",

I sold my Poly600, to help pay for a refurbished OP-1. I also wanted more interaction with visuals and picked up a Keith McMillen BopPad, which could send out CC messages to control parameters on the Critter & Guitari ETC pedal. \nI also struggled with the limitations of social media. I wanted to make long improvised sessions, but platforms were built for short content. I would post full-length versions on YouTube, but they didn't get many views. The most popular music channels leaned toward synthfluencer-style content, where people talked about new gear. I wanted to stay focused on music itself. A few companies reached out for sponsorships, but I turned them all down. I wanted to create like I create, with instruments I like. Not review gear, and especially not influence anyone to buy stuff. \nThe OP-1 was the first synth that let me record myself live and manipulate playback speed, opening up new possibilities for ambient looping based on the live sound. I also got an Eventide Pitchfactor to transform the monophonic voice of the Mother 32 into chords. At that time, I was avoiding computers in live performance and focused on recreating end-of-chain processing with hardware. I got an OTO Bam Reverb and a mixer with three FX sends, allowing me to mix my synths live and record the stereo signal in my computer. This was also about speeding up the mixing process as sounds were locked in together.",

Players like Mason Self, Arthur Hnatek, and Ian Chang were part of this growing community. It was a generous and open space where people shared ideas and answered questions about gear and setups. \nAround my 250th video, a well-known drummer referred me for a major gig. It would be a two-year high-profile world tour that required playing Sensory Percussion. At the time, Sensory Percussion was still relatively new. It's a system of drum sensors that transform any drum into a highly customizable MIDI controller. \nIt felt like proof that my daily videos were leading me exactly where I needed to be. With the tour on the horizon, I immersed myself in learning everything I could about Sensory Percussion, preparing to integrate it into my playing. \nSensory Percussion allowed me to add even more layers to my sound. I built sample packs out of household objects and used them in my daily sessions, making them available on my dedicated sample Bandcamp page. I also built a custom drum set specifically for Sensory Percussion, cutting cheap toms in half and wrapping them in black sparkle. \nI could trigger samples from different drum zones while layering drones with the Mother 32 and playing the OP-1 manually. I also experimented with magnetic contact mics, sending the sound of steel percussion into effects. I wanted a setup that could go in any direction. \nWanted to continue in a more portable solution, I picked up a cheap 84hp modular rack, placed the Mother 32 inside, and impulsively ordered an Intellijel Azimuth II for panning and an Erica Synths Black Mixer for compact mixing. I didn't have a clear plan or knew anything about modular synth, but connecting modules at random let me create unpredictable, chaotic sounds while keeping my setup small and portable.",

      "text": "The final months of the daily video project overlapped with more live shows and it became increasingly difficult to keep up. I also felt mounting pressure for the 365th video, as if it needed to be a grandiose ending. \nI wished I could have ended the series by announcing my departure for the two-year tour, but I was still waiting on the manager to confirm dates. Only the bands I played with knew, as I had already told them to start looking for a replacement. \nI felt conflicted. While I enjoyed making videos online, some peers labeled me an “Instagram drummer,” a term used to diminish what I was building. Instead of support, I sensed quiet resentment from those around me, as if recognition or progress only counted if it followed an unspoken order. Despite gaining traction in a niche online community, this project had not created any local opportunities for me. \nMy 365th video was longer, 11 minutes instead of 2–5, and served as an announcement that I would be shifting toward more complete works, moving away from the short-form content social media encouraged. \nI have a habit of announcing my next project within the final piece of a work. The last song of every album hints at what's coming next. Video 365 was no different. I posted it from the airport while leaving for a series of shows in China. \nAt this point, my setup had evolved further. I added two oscillators, Mutable Instruments Plaits and 2hp Pluck, as well as a Squarp Instruments Hermod for MIDI-to-CV conversion. The OP-1 became the heart of my setup, sending MIDI to the Hermod, which split the notes between different voices. Using the OP-1's endless sequencer combined with MIDI chance effects allowed for a degree of controlled randomness. The system being semi-autonomous while I focused on drums, making my role more about live mixing the voices rather than controlling every sound. I leaned into more experimental and aggressive sonic territory, inspired by power ambient artists like Tim Hecker. \nIn the caption of video 365, I announced that I would continue making sessions, but at a slower pace. I wanted to focus on quality over quantity, breaking out of the patterns I had relied on to complete the year-long project. In the following three months, I released ten new sessions.",

      "text": "I found a Tascam Porta-05 4-track cassette recorder at a flea market and started experimenting with it without posting any videos. My focus was on pitch manipulation, inspired by Hainbach, but approached cyclically. \nI recorded five minutes of sound using my modular synth and OP-1, pitched it down an octave to double the length, and repeated the process three more times. This left me with five, ten, twenty, and forty-minute versions. Since this had to be done in real time, it forced me to sit with the playback process and think ahead, recording ideas a few octaves higher to anticipate the final form. \nAround this time, Cuckoo launched Jamuary, a daily synth video challenge, and I wanted to participate. It was the perfect opportunity to go further in this tape process. I did the pitch manipulation off camera, but performed with the results in real time, shaping them through my modular synth and adding sounds with my drums and op-1. \nHaving 20 to 40-minute tracks meant I couldn't afford to start over, and like the 365-video project, I wasn't allowed to delete anything if I didn't like the result. Every piece had to be completed and posted. It became an exercise in patience. If I felt I had already reached a peak with drums and nothing more needed to be said, I would simply sit on the floor or walk out of frame, letting the textures continue until they faded out naturally. Dealing with tape allowed me to experiment with Izotope RX to tame hiss sounds and artifacts. By the end of the month, I had recorded and published over ten hours of music. \nFor the last video, I spent the final 15 minutes slowly tearing down my drums, removing all gear, and walking around with the OP-1 in my hands, its built-in speaker playing into the room's mics. This approach of moving sound through space would unknowingly become central to my artistic process years later.",

As before, textures were primarily driven by the OP-1, but now some sounds would only open up after a physical hit. This created a direct link between percussion and the electronics. \nI also mic'ed a Dictaphone while playing back audio at slower speeds.

Still avoiding computers, I started researching stereo tape saturation pedals that offered wow and flutter. There are surprisingly not many. I landed on the Strymon Deco and placed it at the end of my signal chain, after reverb, same way I'd been using plugins like Sketch Cassette and Softube Tape in my mixes. \nI felt like the end of chain is one of those components that really makes a difference in artist's sound. I've always been drawn to the type of compression where sounds fight for space, or when a short note hits a long reverb and slowly bends out of pitch. Those moments keep me interested as a listener. They are more surprising than a direct, clean unaffected sound. \nHaving control over your blend and locking in your sound before handing it to the sound tech means less control for them, which can be a strength if you know what you're doing.

A month would pass, I'd check in again, and they'd say they needed a bit more time and the cycle of unknowing continued. \nPlanning my life became difficult. I lost all my remaining bands, except one, due to the uncertainty as I could never fully commit to future shows. I was about to leave. I was getting fed up with posting videos online and started thinking about moving back to Montreal. Playing solo shows felt like something I could focus on while waiting for the tour. In a way, I was just trying to gain a little control over my life. \nI started playing shows in DIY venues and bars. I applied to every festival I came across and submitted grant applications to try and fund my first full-length album. \nMy synth setup fit into a medium-sized hard case. I'd installed floor tom brackets to prop it up and use it as a low table for my modular synth and OP-1. A few months earlier, Qu-Bit Electronix had asked me to make samples for their Nebulae V2. I sent them in, and when they found out I didn't own the module, they surprised sent one for free (!!) \nIt became a central part of my setup. I'd load short samples that included the previous one, letting me build up layers and fill in gaps between “songs”. My setup felt solid. \nI recorded every show with a Zoom H6. I'd strap it to the top of the bass drum to capture the center of the kit, place a mic inside the kick, one on the ground, and use the two remaining inputs for my synth. It was a way to get more out of each performance. Posting full shows helped me stay active on social media while showing I exist in real life. \nOne show was in a concrete loft above a garage. Afterward, I told the people living there how lucky they were to have a space like that to host shows. They said, “If you want it, it's yours. We're leaving next month.” \nI impulsively accepted the lease. It was more expensive than anything I'd rented before, but I didn't care. I was supposed to leave the country once the tour began. This would be temporary. A space to record my album. They told me the building was empty after 6 p.m., and there were no noise limits.",

I could place them anywhere in the room and often used the safety stairwell to capture natural reverb without any direct sound. It felt like a real-life plugin. \nThe only constraint was that I could only record once the building was empty to not disturb anyone. I'd been told the neighboring business closed at 6 p.m., but in reality, it was often much later. I eventually found out there had been several complaints about the previous tenants, and that the person who leased me the space had lied and wasn't actually the landlord. That meant I had no protection. If someone complained, I could be kicked out without notice. \nAnother odd thing, the boss of the company next door started staying all night, often leaving around 4 a.m. I'd sit there for hours, staring at my setup, listening through the paper-thin walls, hoping he'd leave so I could record. \nNot knowing when I could record made everything stressful. When I felt that the building was empty, I'd walk around outside to make sure all lights were off, then come back and track as many drums as I could, playing to nothing and imagining the music in my head. I would later layer synths over these tracks and videotaped every instrument in the same style as Jack Conte’s VideoSongs. \nUnlike my earlier 400+ videos, these weren't live performances.

I'd made tuned chimes from curtain poles, a two-octave glass marimba, and more. I thought I could make and sell these through my videos on social media. \nThe building I lived in was next to an aluminum shop, and went through their scraps to find pieces large enough for bells. I also ordered two 4x8 sheets of mild steel. Usually, steel cymbals, like Keplinger or Mongiello, are made from stainless steel, but I'd been playing Morfbeats instruments made from mild steel and liked that darker tone. \nThe loft was big enough that I built a “room” out of plastic sheets just for cymbal making. I created a jig to trace circles and cut them with a grinder. I made cymbals in sizes 24”, 26”, 28”, and 32”, and saved a 48x48 piece for later. At first, I hammered them on an anvil, but preferred using a block of wood. That way, the metal expanded instead of compressing. The sound felt great with synths and ambient textures. I was also into very dead-sounding drums at the time. These tones combined would form the sound palette for my album. \nAs a joke, I drilled a hole in the center of the 48x48 sheet of steel and placed it on a stand. It actually sounded good, a defined stick sound with a low hum. I slowly hammered it into shape over a few weeks, cut it into a circle, and it became a 48” ride.",

I wanted to be immersed and use the space as an instrument, slowly getting into sound installation territory. \nI started applying that cyclical processing to everything, feeding the recorded space back into the speaker structure while layering more on top. \nI was also wondering how I could make electronic recordings sound more like having musicians in the same room. I recreated bleed through the drum mics. While tracking drums, I'd play the tracks through the monitors at low levels as I played on top. That sound would embed into each mic. \nThe delay on the drums in \"The Time, The Time Is Spent\" was live in the room as I played. \nThe original bass in \"Circus\" overloaded my monitors, creating a popping sound.

I used DearVR Pro to spatialize sounds and recreate rooms, and Kush Pusher to emulate broken amps and saturation. I re-amped drums through the 48” ride cymbal, using a Dictaphone pressed against the steel plate and recording it with a contact mic. I did something similar with the speaker of the OP-1. \nAround that time, I also started questioning video numbering. It felt like I was chasing quantity so I stopped counting at 524. \nWanting to bridge the gap between social media and real life, I started practicing talking to a camera. After quietly releasing Waiting Space, I posted a 35-minute video walking through the process behind each track.",

Since I wasn't using the main control room, what I was doing was seen as secondary. I'd show up and find my gear moved, my instruments used, sometimes even missing a mic. Despite the price, nearly double that of a regular rehearsal space, it became hard to rely on. \nI eventually found another spot, half the cost, run collectively by people I knew. Booking was simple and I had a corner to myself where I could leave my drums and gear set up. The room was slightly apart from the rest in the building and quiet enough to record. It wasn't transit-accessible, but I could bike there. \nNot long after, I also moved into an apartment alone, which gave me space for a proper work desk and a permanent interface setup. I expanded my modular synth and built a DIY rack inside a suitcase. I wanted this to be my instrument. \nI rarely used the new studio. The modular rig was bulky to bike with, especially alongside my laptop and cameras, so I recorded mostly at home. These sessions were drumless, focused on glitching textures with QuBit Data Bender, shaping the final signal with Endorphin.es Golden Master, and cleaning the output using Ladik Silenzio!. The WMD Performance Mixer made it easy to send anything to effects like my OTO BAM reverb. I was preparing for when venues would reopen. \nAs a personal challenge, I started speaking after each performance. I noticed people engaged more on YouTube when someone spoke. I didn't want to fall into synthfluencer territory, so I kept it focused on my personal creative process.",

It gave me a sense of controlled randomness that was still locked to my playing, while allowing rhythmic freedom. \nMy OP-1 had been out of commission for a while, after I spilled liquid on it during a session. The replacement part had been out of stock for months. \nI used a KMI QuNexus to send pitch CV to Mutable Instruments Plaits for bass notes. The rhythm was dictated by the bass drum. I could select a root note with my hand, let it play with my foot, then shift to another, freeing up my hands for the drum kit. \nAfter the show, I made a video explaining that experience and how I had created a setup that was quick to assemble, easy to perform, and self-contained for monitoring.",

Inspired by this concept, I started researching aircraft throat mics that I could hack for Eurorack. I ended up placing two piezos inside a belt. \nA company released an audio-to-CV converter, which allowed me to double my voice with synth tones while also sending out control voltage. \nI liked the idea of my body being directly tied to the electronics. What ended up being more interesting wasn’t singing over my sounds, but how vocal gestures could modulate parameters. I had been using Instruō Arbhar to record and scatter grains, and singing internally could shift those grains or affect effect depth. \nAt the time, the module was a bit unreliable, and I eventually let go of the setup.

First, I placed the pressure surface upside down on my snare, letting each of its four pressure-sensitive corners send CV signals to my Eurorack to shape effect parameters. \nThe second approach involved sending sound through physical objects using the wing. With enough signal, I could make those objects resonate and hear it physically in the room. I'd mic this while experimenting with different types of bridges between the wing and mic surface to shape tone or introduce rhythm, depending on how the material responded. \nRouting sound through objects and sometimes back into itself added a kind of texture I couldn't get from electronics alone.",

      "text": "For this album, I wanted to focus on texture without the pressure of adding drums or building toward a climax. Just a mood, and then out. \nIn earlier releases, I felt obligated to include drums. They are my main instrument and a part of me. I feel exposed on stage without them like I'm missing a protective shield between myself and the audience. This time, I let go of that. The first song is full drums, direct, in-your-face, as a statement. The second folds in on itself, built mostly from the snare chains, with everything else in the background. Then comes in the flood, where drums disappear entirely. \nMost rhythmic elements still came from drums, but they were mangled using Ableton Warp modes. Playing loosely within a steady structure confuses the beat algorithm and creates unstable, glitchy patterns. \nThe album was made in the small apartment I shared. I had no desk, so everything was created directly on my laptop or through temporary setups. One night, I spilled liquid on the OP-1 mid-recording. It started looping itself in tape mode. That became Out of Your Depth. It may have created the water theme that runs through the album. \nTo embed my space into the music, I recorded in the bathroom. A small tiled space with no windows. I wanted to recreate the feeling of submersion. Sounds were reamped underwater using speakers sealed in plastic bags and captured with hydrophones. A geophone suctioned to the outside of the tub added another layer. I pitched the recordings down to exaggerate the effect, dragging everything lower, like sinking deeper. The result matched how I felt: stuck, unsure where to aim, with everything canceled. Shows, tours, residencies, still in the middle of the pandemic. \nIn 2016, my EP Sun and Ice ended with a track called Wanderlust. It captured the desire to leave. Years later, that feeling had not changed. I had somehow circled back. Instead of writing a sequel, I recreated the original piece. \nI rebuilt the synths and re-amped the new version in the bathroom, playing it back at 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, and 32x speed, collapsing the entire song into a split second. When each version was brought back to pitch, the room's reverb stretched with it. Lush, long tails. Real reflections warped in time. \nAs the piece evolves, the sound shifts through those layers, as if the space is expanding. \nI named the album Wanderlust II. A promise made a second time.",

They had seen some of the work I'd posted online and asked if I wanted to participate in a micro-festival/residency inside their 157-speaker dome. \nAt the time, I was preparing to leave music entirely. I'd been accepted into a welding course to switch careers, but it kept getting postponed due to COVID. I almost declined the invitation to avoid a possible conflict with the class. But after some thought, I said yes. \nThey invited me to visit the dome. At the end of the tour, they asked what software I used for spatialization. I hadn't even considered that. \nUp until then, I had only used DearVR for binaural headphone mixes, never for physical spatialization. They gave me a few options and I chose SPAT GRIS, a spatial mixer developed by the University of Montreal. \nSPAT GRIS allowed me to draw spatial paths and route tracks from Ableton into SPAT GRIS and into the dome. \nI had two main constraints. I wanted everything to be live, and my synth setup only output stereo. Because of that, instead of sending stems or individual sounds to different speakers, I chose to spatialize effects. All the sound came from a single source, but each effect moved independently through the space. I also reintroduced Sensory Percussion, letting me trigger any sound directly into SPAT GRIS. \nMany of the spatial instincts I'd developed in virtual mixes translated well to the dome. I liked placing high-frequency distortion near the top, low frequencies near the floor, and fragmented textures crossing the middle. I also avoided circular motions, aiming for more unpredictable paths, sound moving in all directions. \nThis experience showed me how much I enjoy playing with space in real time. I preferred being inside the sound with the audience rather than performing in front of them separated by a stage. It also forced me into using a computer live, something I had not done until then.",

It felt like the right direction to grow into, both creatively and as a way to adapt to where the field was heading. \nAfter that first residency, SAT invited me to attend many shows. This gave me the chance to observe how others approached the dome and how it felt from the inside. \nA performance that had an impact on me was by MONOCOLOR, an audiovisual artist who used the dome to create a true sense of infinite depth. It didn't feel like being inside a circular structure, it felt like drifting through expansive, open environments. That aligned with how I was trying to approach the dome during my own session and made me more aware of the potential to create an experience that extends beyond the physical room. \nAround that time, I also attended a conference called IMMERSA, focused on immersive technologies. That's where I first came into contact with XP4L, a tool designed to make spatial audio more playable. It's an intuitive Max for Live interface built around IRCAM SPAT. \nExploring XP4L gave me full control over shaping an environment. Object size, direction, room reflections, distance, linear movement, custom speaker structures. Everything can be customized in real time. \nI was invited back to Satosphère for another residency, this time working with their updated system: 94 speakers, each with its own channel. For this project, I set aside modular synths completely and focused solely on Sensory Percussion. \nI mapped specific gestures to spatial parameters, treating the dome not as a landscape, but as an extension of my pads. Harder hits would push sounds upward and add distortion. Faster rhythms would accelerate the movement of sound. A single bass drum hit would sidechain the high frequencies across the dome, pulling focus downward. \nThe residency was short, with just a few half-days, so I wasn't able to fully develop every idea, but it gave me a strong foundation and a second immersive experience to build on. \nA major challenge with electronic drumming into the space was latency. There were many programs running in series: Sensory Percussion into Ableton, into Max, back into Ableton, into Dante and finally into the speaker structure. It made tight control difficult. \nLeaving that residency, I started to rethink the issue. Maybe the answer wasn't to fight latency, but play with it. If an acoustic instrument was placed in the space, the direct sound would naturally arrive first and the spatialized version would follow, turning the dome into an extension of the instrument."

I started by experimenting with synths next to the drums, but quickly became focused on the grand piano. I had brought a MicroGranny II sampler and placed it inside. \nI would play the piano, record it with the MicroGranny's internal mic, pitch shift the sound, send it through my modular synth, add effects using FX Aid, then route everything into my audio interface and out through the PA. \nI started working in cycles. Piano into MicroGranny, MicroGranny into modular, modular into PA, and adding more piano on top of that. \nI would mix the sound in Ableton so it would sit well in the PA at every pass. I recorded drum takes over these layers too, letting sounds bleed naturally into the microphones, then sent those recordings back into the process. \nI set a goal of capturing two or three short soundscapes each night. I stayed in the music building after everyone had gone to bed to make use of the silence and extra time. After a few days, I realized I had a full album. I finalized mixing through the PA while laying down in the center of the room. A picture from that perspective became the cover. \nSound constraints shaped the recordings as well. One night, another drummer’s sound was leaking into my room. To work around it, I played a melody four octaves higher than where I was hearing it and pitched it down afterward. This pushed the bleed into sub frequency range. Their sound practically disappeared. \nI named this album Timelines as I felt I had shifted realities.",

This became my reason to go to New York. \nBeing at their HQ gave me a glimpse into how their team was hand-making instruments and all the detail and work involved. Their space at New Lab in the Navy Yard was surrounded by startups working in electronics, robotics, and bioengineering. It was inspiring. \nI went a bit over the top trying to experience everything, not knowing when I would get this opportunity again. I did more than time allowed. Jazz clubs where the musicians I looked up to as a teen were playing, tiny bars with techno sets, DIY spaces, galleries. Every genre was its own micro-community. From harsh noise to hour-long drones, there was an audience and a place for that. \nOne event that impacted me was Haptic Drift by TESTU Collective. The performances focused on multisensory sound art using physicality like transducers on metal, magnetic field-based instruments, and spinning electronics. This made me think about how my albums were built around installations. \nI also attended a lot of networking events, which is something I had never done before. It seemed like there were many spaces where you could seek out like-minded people. I had spent years trying to be noticed online. This was a shift toward walking straight up to people and saying hi. \nI had originally planned to record an album during this stay, or even start a series of location-based albums with the same process as Banff. But I ended up focusing more on finding events, listening, and learning. \nStill, I recorded many small experiments at Physical Synthesis. I tried different objects as bridges between the CICADA's wing and soundboard. They gave me spare soundboard parts, which I completed with a steel plate. I also made a custom CICADA wing with a wooden tip for a more percussive sound. \nI really didn't want to leave. I kept extending my stay, moving between Airbnbs. What was supposed to be three weeks turned into six. Everything felt like it had momentum, but I had to return to real life eventually. \nAs I was preparing to leave, I was also planning my return.

In my application, I described my path from drums to synths to sound design to spatial audio, and proposed a project based on an interactive cymbal MIDI controller. I interpreted “interactive” as audience involvement. I was trying to merge what I had seen at Physical Synthesis with the steel cymbals I had made a few years earlier, layered with a Sensory Percussion mindset. \nThe idea was to create a cymbal you could tilt to open effects and move sound in space, while still using it as an acoustic instrument. \nI arrived at the fellowship not fully knowing what I was getting into. They gave me a desk and access to tools. I had imagined some form of guidance, since it was hosted in an academic institution, but it was completely self-directed. I also felt intimidated being in a school setting again, especially since I’d never finished my undergraduate degree. \nBeing surrounded by students working at the \"intersection of art and technology\" opened up so many possibilities. The idea that you could code anything into anything felt infinite. Why search for the perfect MIDI controller when you could just make one? \nI got an overview of sensors and microcontrollers. I struggled trying to code this instrument and made many mistakes like buying the wrong microcontrollers, or not knowing their limitations. I began with a M5Stack Core2, following a friend’s advice, but it couldn’t appear as a MIDI device over USB. The company then recommended the M5Stack S3, which also wasn’t right for what I needed. Eventually I got an Arduino Teensy and paired it with a MPU9250 gyroscope/accelerometer chip. That finally worked. I was able to convert angle data into MIDI and send it into Ableton over USB. It wasn’t perfect, but it was reliable enough for an installation. I wrote the patch to auto-calibrate every few minutes as it would drift and lose its reference point after some time. Not stable enough for live performance, but it was a good starting point. \nI built a wooden case out of maple I had left over from a previous eurorack case build. \nI had the chance to exhibit the instrument twice. In the first installation, the cymbal controlled effects on looping tracks like delay, filter, distortion, and reverb depending on the axis. An interesting aspect was the physicality—tilting between effects felt like mixing sound with your hands. \nThe second time, I brought mics and my interface. I mounted a mic to the ceiling to capture voices, footsteps, movement, and the sounds of nearby installations. That feed was duplicated, spatialized binaurally, and routed through headphones. Visitors could tilt the cymbal and manipulate their environment in real time. \nThe moment of realization always came with delay. People first assumed they were hearing random noise, then slowly noticed their direct impact on the sound. When they understood that they were interacting with the space, or with themselves, their faces would light up. Kids especially had fun with it. \nIt felt like a direct continuation of the undercurrent in all my work: the connection between sound, space, and physicality. It also opened the door to an entirely new language, one built on microcontrollers, sensors, and the possibility of making custom electronic instruments.",

With that, I could warp and manipulate the sound of any space I was in. \nThis became a way to learn to use Habit pedal as an instrument. A minimalist replacement for the unpredictability I used to create in eurorack. Some degree of chaos, still guided by intention. Using space itself as a sound source removed the focus from synth voices and shifted the attention back to process.",

      "text": "Through the process of working with interactive media, processing space, applying to residencies, fellowships, and grants, I found myself constantly having to articulate what my artistic practice is, what I do and why I do it. The more I reflected, the more I began thinking about where my music ends up. \nI put all this effort into creating sound installations that document space, time and emotions. I use those structures to build recordings. I process and reprocess them through my environment and I carefully shape them into a narrative through mixing. Every layer has intention and weight. \nWhen all of that is done, it is uploaded to streaming. The end. \nThe final form feels very disconnected from the process that created it. I document my work through video. I write about it in album description if word count allows. I share process and behind-the-scenes, but no matter how much context I try to add around it, the end result feels so small. \nOn top of that, musicians are expected to pay yearly fees just to have their work available for free. \nI also realized that streaming platforms had never actually brought any real life opportunities to me. I am not discovered or recommended on there. Streaming doesn’t send people to me, I send people to streaming. They will find me somewhere else, like social media or YouTube, and I am pressured to guide them there. \nIf I can guide people to streaming, I can most likely guide them somewhere else too. My music doesn’t need to be available on all platforms, all the time. \nThis reflection pushed me to delete all my works from streaming and upload only one track. A single 3.5-hour track combining all seven albums into one. It is titled \"Freezing away from the streams.\" \nIt’s anti-playlist, anti-single, anti-short-song. It keeps the works together as intended and it asks the listener to search for what they want, or to sit with it. Similar to a tape cassette. I legacied that track so that it will be up \"forever\" without having to pay again. \nMy music is still available on Bandcamp for now. \nIn the future, I think my work will live in a more creative space. Releasing music should be fun and have a shape that is truer to the process.",

      "text": "I am bringing the same mindset I used outdoors with the field recorder into live performance. Whether in stereo, quadraphonic, octophonic, or bigger multi-channel structures, I’ve been working toward a unified approach to performance. One that adapts to any system, but always centers space itself as an instrument. \nMicrophones are placed to capture the space. Audience movement, instruments, noise, machinery hum is processed live, reshaped, degraded, and fed back into the room and back into the system. I can interact and steer it into form. \nInstead of deciding what sounds will be used, I focus on building the containers that will shape those sounds. It is a system I can use anywhere, as a solo artist or in collaborations. My instrument is the shaping of space. \nIt is responsive and alive.",
