    "short_description": "Node-1 is a wall-mounted listening device. It captures ambient room sound such as voices, footsteps, and movement, and transforms it using granular textures and layered delays. It shifts through different internal states over a 30-minute cycle. A stabilizing synth voice plays slow chords that change qualities every few minutes, helping anchor the space when feedback becomes intense.",
    "back_story": "Node-1 is the foundation for CYCL. I was looking for a way to shape room sound into soundscapes. Reactive, but also generative. With multiple nodes, any space becomes a spatial listening system.",
    "future": "This is the first step of a bigger project. To be continued...",
