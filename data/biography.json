  "bio": [
    "Etienne Mason, known professionally as MAYSUN, is a composer and sound artist whose work transforms physical spaces into immersive sound environments.",
    "Centered around the use of modular systems, DIY electronics, and cyclical processing, MAYSUN develops adaptable sound structures that interact with and reshape the contexts they inhabit. Blurring the lines between site-responsive installations and performances, his practice creates moments where sound, the room, and the listener become inseparable.",
    "In addition to his artistic practice, MAYSUN serves on the Board of Directors of the Canadian Electroacoustic Community (CEC) since 2023. He completed the 2024 ITP/IMA Fellowship at New York University, participated in the New Amsterdam Composers Lab, and is currently a mentor at NEW INC."

  "statement": [
    "MAYSUN explores how spatial audio, environmental sound, technology, and emotional resonance combine to create immersive experiences.",
    "Through an ongoing process of documentation, self-archiving, and experimentation, he creates works that resist traditional music industry formats, emphasizing experience over product. His evolving platform Forever In Sound reflects this approach, offering a continuous living archive of sound, space, and memory.",
    "His recent work focuses on developing portable spatial sound systems that adapt to diverse environments, making immersive audio accessible in any space."
