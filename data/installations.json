    "description": "The Listening Field\nSpeak, whisper, shout.\nThe space hears you, distorts you, and answers back.\n\nVoices drift and return changed.\nNo memory. Only echoes.\n\nPass through. Follow the sound. Take a seat.\nStay as long as you like. The room is listening.",
    "technical": "Two Daisy Seed microcontrollers record audio through MAX9814 capsules posititioned on different walls. Room sound is captured, transformed, and sent through several audio paths that oscillate over a set period of time. A digital polyphonic synthesizer is programmed to generate chords every few seconds while shifting between specific melodic modes every few minutes. The installation occupied two vacant office rooms, one serving as a transitional space, and the other as the main interactive sound environment.",
